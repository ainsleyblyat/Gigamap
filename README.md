# Gigamap
Gigamap offers a full 16k equirectangular world map featuring provinces, borders and states spanning from today to as far as the late 1700's in its current form. The map itself is highly detailed, including tiny islands, a fully supported terrain map and a vast array of alternative coastlines for you to play around with.

In regards to videos - the problem of filesize may rise up due to the sheer scale of the map. For this, a good solution is to crop out each individual continent/region and to use fade in/outs during videos. Or, if you can bear the load on your 2 decade old harddrive, do whatever you want.
